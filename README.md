# ForestQuery Data Analysis Report

**Introduction**  
ForestQuery is dedicated to addressing deforestation globally and raising awareness about its environmental impact. This report analyzes data obtained from the World Bank, including forest and land area by country from 1990 to 2016, along with country regions. The analysis identifies areas of concern and success stories.

**Global Situation**

-   In 1990, the world's forest area was 41,282,694.9 sqkm, which decreased to 39,958,245.9 sqkm in 2016, a loss of 1,324,449 sqkm (3.21%).
-   The forest area lost is greater than the entire land area of Peru for 2016 (1,279,999.98 sqkm).

**Regional Outlook**

-   In 2016, 31.37% of the world's land was designated as forest, with Latin America & Caribbean having the highest relative forestation (46.16%) and Middle East & North Africa the lowest (2.07%).
-   In 1990, 32.42% of the world's land was forested, with Latin America & Caribbean having the highest relative forestation (51.03%) and Middle East & North Africa the lowest (1.78%).
-   Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa are the only regions with decreased forest area from 1990 to 2016.

**Country-Level Detail** **Success Stories**

-   China increased its forest area by 527,229 sqkm from 1990 to 2016.
-   Iceland demonstrated the largest percent change in forest area, with a 213.66% increase.

**Largest Concerns**

-   Top 5 countries with the largest absolute decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016: Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Tanzania.
-   Top 5 countries with the largest percent decrease in forest area: Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania, Honduras.
-   Nigeria is the only country ranking in the top 5 for both absolute and percent decrease in forest area.

**Quartiles**

-   The largest number of countries in 2016 fell in the 1st quartile (0-25% forestation).
-   The top quartile (75% or higher forestation) in 2016 included 9 countries.

**Recommendations**

-   The analysis highlights a global decline in forestation, with regions like Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa facing significant challenges.
-   Countries with substantial forest loss, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, should be prioritized.
-   Success stories like China can offer insights into mitigating deforestation.
